# What do web developers do?

They build and maintain websites. Web Developers often work for clients who are trying to get their product or service onto the web. The work is typically project-focused and usually involves working collaboratively with a team to coordinate the client's needs into the end product. The client could be a tech company, an org, or a government. It can involve front-end, back-end, or full-stack web development. 

Web devs are a good profession if you like solving logical problems, building useful things, and experimenting with new tech. They are in high demand, generally have a good work-life balance, and command comfortable salaries. 

# Types of web developers 

The **front end** is the stuff you see on the website in your browser, including the presentation of content and user interface elements like the nav bar. They use **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and their relevant frameworks to ensure that content is presented effectively and that users have an excellent experience. 

The **back end** refers to the guts of the application, which live on the server. The back end stores and serves program data to ensure that the front end has what it needs. This process can be complicated when a website has millions of users. They use programming languages like **Java**, **Python**, **Ruby**, and **JavaScript** to work with data.

**Full-stack developers** are comfy working with both the front and back end. The [[Odin Project]] focuses on teaching full-stack development, covering all aspects of web dev.

# Types of careers

**Large tech companies**, such as **Google**, **Meta**, and **Amazon**, have very stringent hiring requirements. If successfully met, they offer excellent pay, benefits, and opportunities.

**Startups** are a bit like the wild west. For a junior dev, it can feel like a trial by fire because of the pace of development. They often offer slightly lower salaries and require longer hours, but they may also offer equity in the company and highly unique environments. 

As a **freelancer**, you could command a strong hourly wage and the freedom to schedule and design your own products. However, you would be responsible for getting your own work, managing billing from clients, and being solely responsible. Strong people skills are necessary for this path.

As a **consultant** for a web consultancy, you would give up some of your freelancing wage potential but be able to focus more on the code and less on the hustle. this option also provides a good work-life balance and pay.

Finally, **large, older companies** still need developers. These companies offer a good work-life balance, pay, and benefits but often move slower than a company that is highly focused on tech.

# Motivation

Learning to code can be very rewarding but can be very difficult and frustrating. The strongest assets you can have as a student are:
- A desire to build
- A problem-solving mind
- Persistence in the face of setbacks

Don't imagine this will be easy, but rather take the challenge and accept the hardships that will come as you will learn to persevere. [[Don't Believe Anyone Who Told You Coding is Easy!]] 

The web dev industry has a long history of successful devs with varying backgrounds, so people tend to care more about **what** you built rather than how you got there.
