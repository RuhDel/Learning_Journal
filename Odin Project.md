Lesson Overview:
- Understand how the Odin Project's curriculum works. 
- Understand how the Foundations course works.

Personal Notes: 
- The goal of the Odin Project is not to teach me any standalone skills and it isn't a tutorial. The main idea is to teach me the *why* and change the way I think.
- I will need to adopt a new mindset for this course. I like that.
- This is about developing the following:
	- Problem-solving
	- Asking the right questions
	- Doing enough research
- Reading the documentation of anything I am trying to learn is the best way to learn any tooling.
