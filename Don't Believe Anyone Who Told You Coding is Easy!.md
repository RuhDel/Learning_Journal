**Key Takeaways:**

- **Learning to code is inherently challenging:** Despite the abundance of resources promising quick and easy learning, the process is often frustrating and messy.
    
- **Setting up the development environment can be tedious:** Even experienced programmers find configuring tools and environments to be a source of frustration.
    
- **Effective programming involves strategic problem-solving:** Success in coding often depends on the ability to ask the right questions and efficiently search for solutions, rather than memorizing syntax.
    
- **Continuous learning is essential:** The field of programming is vast and ever-evolving, requiring a mindset that embraces ongoing learning and adaptation.
    
- **Feeling inadequate is part of the journey:** It's normal to feel lost or overwhelmed at times; acknowledging and accepting this can help maintain motivation.
    
- **A practical approach to learning:** Starting with tutorials, even without full comprehension, can build familiarity. Over time, this leads to deeper understanding and proficiency.
    

This article underscores the importance of resilience and a growth mindset in the journey to becoming a proficient programmer.

These are notes that I have taken from the [article](https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/24/dont-believe-anyone-who-tells-you-learning-to-code-is-easy/). 

- Quote that caught my eye: â€œThe anxiety of feeling lost and stupid is not something you learn to conquer, but something you learn to live with."

- Follow a tutorial step-by-step even if you don't always understand what you're doing. Hunter S. Thompson would copy books of the great masters on his typewriter. You're getting a feel for how things are done in the new language/framework. This part is easy, but boring since you're being told what to do. 

- Rebuild the thing you just made or a slight variation of it. Try not to use the tutorial too much. Realize just how little you understood of what you are doing. 

- Try to build something simple that you actually want to make. Discover that you have absolutely no idea what you're doing.

- Find a new tutorial related to your new project. Follow the steps. Rebuild the thing yourself. Start a new project. Repeat.
